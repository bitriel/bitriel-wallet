APPLICTION OR SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE.

# Defition

The architecture you described with the Presentation Layer, Domain Layer, Application, and Data Layer follows a three-tier architecture pattern. This pattern promotes separation of concerns, modularity, and maintainability in software development.

# Here are some benefits of using a three-tier architecture:

- Separation of Concerns: Each layer has a distinct responsibility, allowing for clear separation of concerns. The Presentation Layer focuses on the UI and user interactions, the Domain Layer handles the business logic and rules, and the Data Layer manages data retrieval and storage.

- Modularity: With a clear separation of layers, each layer can be developed and maintained independently. Changes in one layer are less likely to affect the others, promoting modularity and reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

- Scalability and Reusability: The modular nature of a three-tier architecture enables components to be easily reused in different parts of the application or even in other applications. For example, the Domain Layer can be reused in different UI implementations or platforms.

- Maintainability: The separation of concerns and modular design make it easier to understand, update, and maintain the codebase. Changes or updates in one layer can be isolated and tested without affecting the other layers.

- Flexibility: The three-tier architecture allows for flexibility in technology choices. Each layer can be implemented using different frameworks, libraries, or programming languages, as long as they can communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces.

# The three-tier architecture. 
The three-tier architecture is a common software architecture that is used to design and develop large, complex applications

## In this project we follow three-Layers, such as DATA, DOMAIN, APPLICATION and PRESENTATION Layers for project structure.

## Also inside presentation layers we follow Features-First structure.


1. Presentation Tier (Client-side):

User interface components, such as widgets and screens, are implemented in Flutter.
This tier focuses on the presentation and rendering of data to the user.
It interacts with the middle tier to retrieve and update data.

2. Application Tier (Middle-tier):

The middle tier contains the business logic and application-specific functionality.
The "model" folder can be located within this tier.
The model folder contains the data models that represent the structure and behavior of your application's data.
These models may include classes or objects that define entities, such as users, products, or any other data entities relevant to your application.
The middle tier utilizes these models to process and manipulate data.

3. Data Tier (Backend):

The data tier deals with data storage and retrieval.
It includes databases, APIs, or external services that handle the persistence and retrieval of data.
The middle tier interacts with the data tier to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data models.
