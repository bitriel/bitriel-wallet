# DEFINITION

In software architecture, the Application Layer is an additional layer that sits on top of the three-layer architecture (Presentation Layer, Domain Layer, and Data Layer). It focuses on orchestrating and coordinating the interactions between the three layers to implement the application's specific use cases and business logic

=> The application layer represents the features or functionalities of the application.

# PURPOSE

The Application Layer is responsible for handling high-level application concerns such as routing, navigation, authentication, authorization, and coordination of multiple use cases or workflows. It serves as a bridge between the user interface (Presentation Layer) and the core business logic (Domain Layer) while leveraging the data access and storage capabilities (Data Layer).
